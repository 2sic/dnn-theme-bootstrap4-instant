# The Bootstrap4 Instant Theme for DNN

This theme is a layout/skin for the CMS [DNN](https://github.com/dnnsoftware/Dnn.Platform) based on [Bootstrap4 ](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/). It allows you to create simple custom designs within minutes and complex designs within a few hours. This is why it's called *instant*. 

## What's in the Package
1. A clean, best-practices, responsive Bootstrap 3 Skin / Theme
1. ...based on SASS, with a set of variables-files to customize layouts in minutes
1. An e-mail encryptor to encrypt mail addresses in the layout
1. A SEO-title optimizer
1. An automatic svg/png integration for responsive logos
1. Layout footer implementing SEO microformats
1. Bower configuration for all dependencies
1. Gulp to process the sass into the resulting CSS

## Theme Installation
There are three ways to install the initial package

1. By downloading the _package_ and installing it through the web UI of DNN
2. By using `git clone` to create a copy of this repository in your _Skins_ folder
3. By downloading the zip and manually copying it to the _Skins_ folder

You can read more about this under [Installation](https://github.com/2sic/dnn-theme-bootstrap4-instant/wiki/installation).

## Customize and Redesign everything within Minutes
You can now quickly customize and redesign everything within minutes. Check out the instructions on how to [Customize and Redesign](https://github.com/2sic/dnn-theme-bootstrap4-instant/wiki/customize-and-redesign) everything. 

## Creating Awesome Designed Content
You now have created the layout within minutes or hours, but you're still missing the perfectly designed inner pieces, like tile-lists, content-accordeons, galleries, sliders, blogs and more. Fortunately these are both super-easy to add and use the same mechanisms for design. They can even re-use the variables of your skin, to automatically match look and feel :)

To get the awesome designed content, install [2sxc](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/releases) and the default bootstrap4 content-templates. You can then change the SCSS in the content-templates to also point to the `_variables.scss` of this skin, and re-generate all styles for an amazingly fast development workflow.
