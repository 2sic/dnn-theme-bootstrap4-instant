# The Bootstrap4 Instant Theme for DNN

This theme is a layout/skin for the CMS [DNN](https://github.com/dnnsoftware/Dnn.Platform) based on [Bootstrap4](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/). It allows you to create simple custom designs within minutes and complex designs within a few hours. This is why it's called *instant*.

## What's in the Package

1. A clean, best-practices, responsive Bootstrap 4 Skin / Theme
1. ...based on SASS, with a set of variables-files to customize layouts in minutes
1. An e-mail encryptor to encrypt mail addresses in the layout
1. A SEO-title optimizer
1. An automatic svg/png integration for responsive logos
1. Layout footer implementing SEO microformats
1. NPM for all dependencies
1. Webpack to process the sass/typescript into the resulting CSS/Javascript

## Theme Installation

There are three ways to install the initial package

1. [By downloading the _package_ and installing it through the web UI of DNN](https://azing.org/dnn-community/r/jRA6BIxn)
2. [By using `git clone` to create a copy of this repository in your _Skins_ folder](https://azing.org/dnn-community/r/dV0_C3yY)
3. [By downloading the zip and manually copying it to the _Skins_ folder](https://azing.org/dnn-community/r/0DIROnG-)

You can read more about this [here](https://azing.org/dnn-community/r/xmvM_gD7).

## Customize and Redesign everything within Minutes

You can now quickly customize and redesign everything within minutes. Check out the instructions [here](https://azing.org/2sxc/r/TIvm7V0H).

## Creating Awesome Designed Content

You now have created the layout within minutes or hours, but you're still missing the perfectly designed inner pieces, like tile-lists, content-accordeons, galleries, sliders, blogs and more. Fortunately these are both super-easy to add and use the same mechanisms for design. They can even re-use the variables of your skin, to automatically match look and feel :)

To get the awesome designed content, install [2sxc](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/releases) and the default bootstrap4 content-templates. You can then change the SCSS in the content-templates to also point to the `_variables.scss` of this skin, and re-generate all styles for an amazingly fast development workflow.
